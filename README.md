## Description

**NOTE**: This project was developed on macOS. It is for my own personal use.

I'm interested in learning general OS-level things on macOS like how to start, stop and control processes. To learn
those concepts, it's effective to write sample scripts and code that do that. And to do that, it's probably most
effective to do that from the macOS SDK, which means I need to write it in Swift or Objective-C. In 2022, Swift is the
natural choice. So, this playground repository is me learning Swift.

## Instructions

Normally, I would provide instructions to build and run the demo program on the commandline. But for a Swift app, I'm
out of my depth. Apple directs the development experience in a way that tightly couples to the Xcode IDE. An effect of
this is that I'm not sure what "headless macOS/iOS development" looks like. There has to be a way, because CI servers
exist...


## Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Implement something just a bit more interesting than "hello world"
* [ ] How do you implement multi-module Swift projects? What does the directory layout look like? Where do I start?
* [ ] Implement something that starts another process, captures its output, and stops the process.
