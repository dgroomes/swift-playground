## Description

**NOTE**: This project was developed on macOS. It is for my own personal use.

This project is for me to explore the Swift programming language, which is quite rich and at times difficult for me to
wrangle. By contrast, my codebase <https://github.com/dgroomes/macos-playground> is designed to explore macOS platform
APIs and macOS operating system concerns like process management. 

This project is implemented as a multi-module Swift project. I use the term "multi-module" in the general programming
sense. Programming languages and their toolchains use specific language to describe modular program design. Swift programs
built with the Swift Package Manager have an impressive amount of options when it comes to modularity. Just read the later
section [Making Sense of the Swift Package Manager](#making-sense-of-the-swift-package-manager).


## Instructions

Follow these instructions to build and run a demo Swift program:

1. Pre-requisite: Swift
   * I'm using Swift 5.8
2. Build and run the program:
   * ```shell
     swift run
     ```
   * It should look something like this:
     ```text
     $ swift run
     Building for debugging...
     [3/3] Linking SwiftPlayground
     Build complete! (0.33s)
     Welcome to my 'swift-playground'! Let's write some Swift code.
     
     Let's explore concurrency by way of executing multiple simulated 'data fetch' operations.
     Fetching 'inbox' data from an external source...
     Fetching 'news' data from an external source...
     Fetching 'photos' data from an external source...
     Data fetch of 'news' complete!
     Data fetch of 'photos' complete!
     Data fetch of 'inbox' complete!
     Found Fake data for 'inbox'
     Found Fake data for 'photos'
     Found Fake data for 'news'
     All data fetches completed in 3.007364417 seconds.
     ```
3. Build a binary
   * Link the program into a binary executable file with the following command.
   * ```shell
     swift build
     ```
   * Run the program from the binary with the following command.
   * ```shell
     .build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/SwiftPlayground
     ```
   * Tip: if you want to clean up old build files just to "make sure things are working" then use the following clean command.
   * ```shell
     swift package clean
     ```


## Making Sense of the Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/) is really cool. I really like the `Package.swift`
file. It is similar to Gradle in the way that it's a project manifest descriptor but not written in a configuration
language but written in a full weight programming language: Swift for `Package.swift` and Groovy for `build.gradle` or
Kotlin for `build.gradle.kts`. Similarly to Gradle, it's on the higher side of complexity (please note: no build system
matches the gigantic feature set of Gradle). I'm trying to understand the following concepts which are listed in the
docs and how they relate to one another:

* *Modules*
* *Namespaces*
* *Programs*
* *Dependencies*
* *Packages*
* *Targets*
* *Products*
* *Libraries*
* *Executables*

Here are some notable quotes from those docs:

> Swift organizes code into *modules*.

> Each module specifies a namespace and enforces access controls on which parts of that code can be used outside of the
> module.

> A program may have all of its code in a single module, or it may import other modules as *dependencies*.

> A *package* consists of Swift source files and a manifest file.

> A package has one or more targets. Each target specifies a product and may declare one or more dependencies.

> A target may build either a library or an executable as its product.

> A *library* contains a module that can be imported by other Swift code.

> An *executable* is a program that can be run by the operating system.

> A targetâ€™s dependencies are modules that are required by code in the package.

> By convention, a target includes any source files located in the `Sources/<target-name>` directory.


## Wish List

General clean ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [x] DONE (it turns out a Swift project has things like a `Package.swift` file) Structure the project in the way that the Swift *Package Manager* would. Swift has an impressive life outside of
  Apple. Just visit the [Swift website](https://www.swift.org/) to see extensive guides, reference, and community things
  and notice that this information is presented outside the context of Apple. (Of course Apple is still there but not in an overt way)
  This is pretty cool. Can I eject this project from Xcode (well, I'm using AppCode)?. Answer: no, this is not possible.
  [AppCode is not considered a lightweight IDE](https://intellij-support.jetbrains.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360005062659-Can-I-get-Swift-code-completion-and-syntax-highlighting-in-IntelliJ-).
* [x] DONE Implement something just a bit more interesting than "hello world"
* [x] DONE How do you implement multi-module Swift projects? What does the directory layout look like? Where do I start?
* [x] DONE Implement something that starts another process
* [ ] Heed the warning described by the [`FileManager.fileExists` docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/filemanager/1415645-fileexists)
   * > Attempting to predicate behavior based on the current state of the file system or a particular file on the file
       system is not recommended. Doing so can cause odd behavior or race conditions. Itâ€™s far better to attempt an
       operation (such as loading a file or creating a directory), check for errors, and handle those errors gracefully
       than it is to try to figure out ahead of time whether the operation will succeed.
   * This is not something I've taken seriously in my Java code, but I'm happy to write my Swift more robustly in
     this regard.
* [x] DONE Compile/link/whatever a Swift program into a binary executable file
* [x] DONE Write to a file. I want to know the boilerplate to write a new file and append to an existing one.
* [x] DONE Concurrency examples. Specifically, I'll start with `async/await`.
* [x] DONE Clean up the logging stuff. Rebrand it as something like `FileLogger`
  * I'm going to make a logger class.
* [x] DONE Consolidate the example code in `main.swift`.
* [ ] IN PROGRESS Do more concurrency examples. I want to take APIs that I wish supported `async/await`, and adapt them for use with
  `async/await`. The `Process` API is a good candidate for this. However, I may be better off with simulated examples
  using `sleep` or something, to reduce the scope of the project.
* [x] DONE Move the process stuff to <https://github.com/dgroomes/macos-playground>. The `Process` API is really a concept
  of the operating system APIs and not the Swift language. I want to keep this project focused on the Swift language.
