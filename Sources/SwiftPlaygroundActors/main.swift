print("Let's implement something with actors and level up our Swift concurrency skills.\n")

/*
 To learn about actors, let's invent a sample domain. Let's have multiple tasks compete against one another other in a
 simulated "race to the finish line" competition. The first task to finish is the winner. We'll simulate each task's
 racing behavior (from start to finish) with the 'sleep' function over a random duration. When the first task completes,
 it will reference some "finishOrder" shared mutable state and declare itself the winner for finishing first. The
 other tasks will see, from the "finishOrder" state, that they did not finish first.
 
 It's important that the "finishOrder" state is implemented in a way that is safe for concurrent data access. For
 example, consider if task A and task B finish in the same microsecond, will they both simultaneously read the
 "finishOrder" state and mistakenly think that they are both the first to finish? There can't be two winners. We need
 to write the program correctly. Let's explore how to do that with actors.
 
 A Track & Field racing example is especially apt because in programming, we use the term "race condition" to describe
 the general problem of programming errors related to improperly handling all cases for concurrent tasks, leading to
 wrong/undefined behavior.

    // whatever you can relate this to in the programming languages that you personally know). You can do 'async let' but

    // function call) in a 'Task'. We can cancel this 'Task' at our leisure.
